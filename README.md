# Website and responsive portfolio
In this assignment, I was responsible for creating a responsive website that could be viewed on multiple plaforms and that contained resizable elements.
My finished product includes a website that has a navar for both web and mobile accessibility, rows and columns for layout orientation, and an interactive contact form (not yet functional). 
This assignment pushed my ability to creatively and successfully create a web layout that could be aesthetically pleasing and functional on numerous platforms without having to rely extensively on media queries. While I did utilize media queries, the foundation of my webpage is based on the organizational elements of Bootstrap 3's rows and columns.
Despite it's difficulty, I enjoyed creating a final product for this assignment.
